# Wild Cards - Inspiration Alternative
When a player does something very cool or heroic, instead of giving them Inspiration, reward them with a random draw from a standard deck of cards.

That player gets to keep the card until they decide to spend it or until the current adventure is resolved.
A player can't hold more than two cards, and if they gain a card while holding two, the GM gets the card to spend.

When the GM does something very cool or funny, the players can decide to reward the GM with a card, which they can give to any character they want.

When a player decides to spend the card, they get a benefit corresponding to the card’s suit and number:

## Numerals [2 to 10] (66.67%)

|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|add half the number rounded up to a skill/ability check.
♥|Heart|regain half the number rounded up in HP (unless HP = 0).
♣|Club|add the half the number rounded up to a damage roll.
♦|Diamond|the player finds double the number in gold pieces.

## Court (22.22%)
### Jack
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|re-roll a die, but keep the first number and use it the next time you have to roll that die.
♥|Heart|regain 11 HP, but deal 5 damage to the player that currently has the most HP.
♣|Club|deal 11 damage to a random enemy, but heal 11 HP to another.
♦|Diamond|gain a single use spell slot for a random level 1 spell.

### Queen
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|gain +1 for a skill of your choice, until the session ends.
♥|Heart|move a curse/effect from an object/creature, to another, or cast Bless on a creature.
♣|Club|when attacking, attack once more.
♦|Diamond|Find an object that you know some one is looking for (GM's discretion).

### King
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|add +1 to an ability modifier for a day.
♥|Heart|you naturally charm a character, until you cause harm to them or do something very foolish.
♣|Club|you naturally frighten a character, until you make amends or do something very foolish.
♦|Diamond|find a diamond.

## Ace (7.41%)
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|critically succeed/fail a skill check.
♥|Heart|when your HP is reduced to 0, immediately regain 20 HP and be stabilized.
♣|Club|critically succeed/fail an attack.
♦|Diamond|refill a depleted item or regain a spell slot.

## Joker (3.70%)
The player finds a random rare item (the next time they loot a boss) that suits their character. Meaning, if a wizard spends a joker, make sure they receive a random wand, or a scroll, or something that they can use, unlike a heavy sword or a full plate armor, which would suit a fighter.  
The item is cursed. The curse can be removed when a character decides to spend a Queen of Hearts to do so.
