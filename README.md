# Wild Cards - Inspiration Alternative
When a player does something very cool or heroic, instead of giving them Inspiration, reward them with a random draw from a standard deck of cards[^1].
[^1]: A deck with 54 cards, where all cards, except the two Jokers, have a suit (♠♥♣♦) and a value (numeral [2 to 10], Jack, Queen, King, or Ace).

That player gets to keep the card until they decide to spend it or until the current adventure is resolved.
A player can't hold more than two cards, and if they gain a card while holding two, they must gift one of the three to the GM.

When the GM does something very cool or funny, the players can decide to reward the GM with a card, which they can give to any character they want.

When a player decides to spend the card, they get a benefit corresponding to the card’s suit and number:

When a card is spent, put it in the pile of spent cards. Add the pile of spent cards back into the pile of unspent cards either when the current adventure is resolved, or when the pile of unspent cards is empty.

## Numerals [2 to 10] (66.67%)
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|add half the number rounded up to a skill/ability check.
♥|Heart|regain half the number rounded up in HP (unless HP = 0).
♣|Club|add half the number rounded up to a damage roll.
♦|Diamond|find double the number in gold pieces.

## Court (22.22%)
### Jack
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|re-roll a die, but keep the first number and use it the next time you have to roll that die.
♥|Heart|regain 11 HP, but deal 5 damage to the player that currently has the most HP.
♣|Club|deal 11 damage to a random enemy, but heal 11 HP to another.
♦|Diamond|gain a single use spell slot for a random[^2] level 1 spell.
[^2]: It's up to the GM to decide whether the spell is determined when the Jack's drawn (recommended), or when it's cast (fun chaos). If a middle-ground is desired, they can determine that when it's drawn, the player can choose (or roll for) if the spell is harmful or helpful, and then determine the spell when it's cast.

### Queen
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|gain +1 for a skill of your choice, until the session ends.
♥|Heart|move a curse/effect from an object/creature, to another, or cast Bless on a creature.
♣|Club|when attacking, attack once more.
♦|Diamond|find an object that you know some one is looking for (GM's discretion).

### King
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|add +1 to an ability modifier for a day.
♥|Heart|you naturally charm a character, until you cause harm to them or do something very foolish.
♣|Club|you naturally frighten a character, until you make amends or do something very foolish.
♦|Diamond|find a diamond.

## Ace (7.41%)
||||
|:-:|:-:|-|
♠|Spade|critically succeed/fail a skill check.
♥|Heart|when your HP is reduced to 0, immediately regain 20 HP and be stabilized.
♣|Club|critically succeed/fail an attack.
♦|Diamond|refill a depleted item or regain a spell slot.

## Joker (3.70%)
The player finds a random rare item (the next time they loot a boss) that suits their character. Meaning, if a wizard spends a Joker, make sure they receive a random wand, a scroll, or something that they can use, unlike a heavy sword or a full plate armor, which would suit a fighter. A rare wonderous-item (without prequisites) is a good option.
The item is cursed. The curse can be removed when a character decides to spend a Queen of Hearts to do so.
